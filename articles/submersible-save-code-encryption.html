      <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/811805586/">Submersible</a> has a lot of data to save. I use my <a href="my-save-code-format">CSKV format</a> which is designed to be very simple to read/write, both by Scratch projects and manually by a person. This does mean it is possible to cheat as it is unencrypted, however a checksum is used for the most important values rendering such attempts difficult to succeed with, enough that going inside the project and editing it is <i>far easier</i>. Seriously, if you want to cheat, go inside the project, enable dev mode, and use the cheat commands. Manual edits of a save code being possible is deliberate as it makes debugging easier as well as data recovery, which I have personally done multiple times.
