    <h1>Project Development Time Summary</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This is a compilation of the time spent working on each project. Estimations of hours are approximate as I do not keep track of them. They are calculated assuming a few hours are spent most days of the week.
    </p>

    <h3>Animdustry</h3>
    <p>100-200 hours, completed over 1.5 years. Development was split into two parts with about a 1 year break in the middle.</p>

    <h3>The Mast</h3>
    <p>100-200 hours, completed over 2 months. A large amount of the time went to creating each region of the world, many took around 6 hours to make.</p>
