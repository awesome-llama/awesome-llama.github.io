      According to commenters on my profile and projects...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Flight simulator 737-800</i> was developed and released during a time of 737 MAX crashes and groundings.</li>
      <li><i>Drone</i> depicted Sisyphus, which became a meme.</li>
      <li><i>Flight simulator An-225</i> was released before the aircraft was destroyed during the invasion of Ukraine.</li>
      <li><i>The Mast</i> was released at a time New York's sky looked the same.</li>
      <li><i>Submersible</i> was released months before the Titan submersible implosion.</li>
      <li>My username contains the word "llama", which is the name of Meta's large-language ("AI") models.</li>
