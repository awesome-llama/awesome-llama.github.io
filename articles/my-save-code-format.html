    <h1>My Save Code Format</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Over many years of developing Scratch projects, I have settled on a simple-to-use and easy-to-understand save code format and now use it on pretty much everything.
    I call it CSKV, which loosely stands for comma-separated key/values. The only reserved chars are colon <span class="code">:</span> and comma <span class="code">,</span>. I usually don't need escape characters so my implementation does not use them but it's quite simple to modify to account for.</span></p>
    <p>Example (with colour showing the <span class="key">key</span> and <span class="val">values</span>):</p>
    <p class="code">
        <span class="key">user</span>:<span class="val">awesome-llama</span>,<span class="key">id</span>:<span class="val">8832510</span>,<span class="key">scratchteam</span>:<span class="val">false</span>
    </p>
    <p>But what happens if you need to store more than a single value? There is support for lists stored alongside each key. Implementation depends on the project but the general setup is to have the first number after a key representing <span class="len">the length of the list</span>:</p>
    <p class="code">
        <span class="key">recent_projects</span>:<span class="len">3</span>,<span class="val">The Mast</span>,<span class="val">Submersible</span>,<span class="val">Road Network Designer</span>
    </p>
    <p>The code responsible for reading the save code will be designed to understand what data is expected for a given key. For example, <span class="code">recent_projects</span> will be expected to be a list, the length determined by the first item. <span class="code">user</span> will be expected to always be a single value.</p>
    
    <p>I often include a <span class="magic_num">magic number</span> at the start of the save code, like this:</p>
    <p class="code">
        <span class="magic_num">account_info</span>,<span class="key">user</span>:<span class="val">awesome-llama</span>,<span class="key">id</span>:<span class="val">8832510</span>,<span class="key">scratchteam</span>:<span class="val">false</span>
    </p>
    <p>This helps to ensure the data comes from the right place as well as ensure I know what a save code stores.</p>
    <p>Also, with save codes that are intended to be used by others and not just something internally-used, I ensure a project version number is provided as a key, along with optional username and date the code was generated. The following example is from my game Submersible but trimmed down to show the first part with the version (<span class="code">v</span> for project version, <span class="code">sv</span> for save code version) and time (<span class="code">t</span>, seconds since 2000):</p>
    <p class="code">
        <span class="magic_num">SUB</span>,<span class="key">v</span>:<span class="val">1.0</span>,<span class="key">sv</span>:<span class="val">1</span>,<span class="key">t</span>:<span class="val">731066503</span>,[...]

    <p>Here is a Scratch project with the scripts I typically use to implement it: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/114633511/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/114633511/</a></p>

    <p>If using this for a save code that saves game progress, it is apparent that the simplicity and readability also means it is easy to cheat. In my opinion, this doesn't matter as the "see inside" button exists on all Scratch projects and provides many more opportunities to cheat. I suggest if you want to stop the simplest, most opportunistic cheating, you include a checksum for the important values (e.g. currency, high score).</p>
