    <h1>Username Origin</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My username has no meaning, it was made on a whim with no conscious reason. I made my Scratch account so I could save my projects online.</p>
    <p>Ironically, this username is still in use. It outlasted my "serious" "made-for-permanence" username, which is now effectively abandoned and I shall not name here. It was only used on other sites. At least I learnt more of what not to do. For example, ensure there is an obvious English pronunciation and spelling.</p>
    <p>By the way, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/awesome">"awesome" historically meant "awe-inspiring"</a>. Maybe you could say that I'm trying to put the "awe" back in "awesome" with my work.</p>
