    <h1>Statistics</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I have extensive records of statistics. I have some Python scripts to log these stats semi-automatically. Here are some graphs...</p>
    
    <img src="/img/stats/followers all time.png" loading="lazy">
    <p class="caption">The 3 different lines correspond to different data sources. The API includes deleted accounts which is why it is a bit higher than the others. Visible followers is the number as seen in the followers page. The stats early on are manually added from screenshots and archives I made of my account. Scratch DB was an unofficial API pulling data from the official API.</p><br>
    
    <img src="/img/stats/follower gain.png" loading="lazy">
    <p class="caption">The change in follower count over time. Uses the same data as the previous graph. Spikes indicate high follower gains (occurs when I share projects).</p><br>

    <img src="/img/stats/views.png" loading="lazy">
    <p class="caption">Views for a bunch of notable projects. Car Parking Challenge is by far the most popular.</p><br>

    <img src="/img/stats/views when shared.png" loading="lazy">
    <p class="caption">Views for my projects, aligned so performance can be compared. Some projects get on trending, others don't.</p><br>

    <img src="/img/stats/lvr.png" loading="lazy">
    <p class="caption">views/loves. Higher is better (more views turned into loves).</p><br>

    <img src="/img/stats/lfr.png" loading="lazy">
    <p class="caption">loves/favorites. Lower means more favorites (which is probably a good thing, they are more valuable than loves).</p><br>

    <img src="/img/stats/rvr.png" loading="lazy">
    <p class="caption">remixes/views. Higher means more remixes. Some projects inflence more remixing than others.</p><br>

    <img src="/img/stats/messages per day.png" loading="lazy">
    <p class="caption">Messages received per day. The many sharp peaks and dips correspond to weekdays and weekends, respectively. The largest peaks are due to sharing projects (The Mast and Animdustry). Pictured is approximately 76000 messages.</p><br>
