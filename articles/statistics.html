    <h1>Statistics</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I have extensive records of statistics. I have some Python scripts to log these stats semi-automatically. Here are some graphs...</p>
    
    <img src="/img/stats/followers all time.png" loading="lazy" title="The 3 different lines correspond to different data sources. The API includes deleted accounts which is why it is a bit higher than the others. Visible followers is the number as seen in the followers page. The stats early on are manually added from screenshots and archives I made of my account. Scratch DB is an unofficial API and can also report the follower count but it's a bit slow to update.">
    <img src="/img/stats/followers close up.png" loading="lazy" title="A close-up of the above graph.">
    <img src="/img/stats/follower gain.png" loading="lazy" title="The change in follower count over time. Uses the same data as the above two graphs. On average I get 1 follower every 2 hours. Spikes indicate high follower gains (occurs when I share projects).">
    <img src="/img/stats/views.png" loading="lazy" title="Views for a bunch of notable projects. Car Parking Challenge is by far the most popular.">
    <img src="/img/stats/views when shared.png" loading="lazy" title="Views for my projects, aligned so performance can be compared. Some projects get on trending, others don't.">
    <img src="/img/stats/lvr.png" loading="lazy" title="views/loves. Higher is better (more loves).">
    <img src="/img/stats/lfr.png" loading="lazy" title="loves/favorites. Lower means more favorites (which is probably a good thing).">
    <img src="/img/stats/rvr.png" loading="lazy" title="remixes/views. Higher means more remixes.">
    <img src="/img/stats/messages per day.png" loading="lazy" title="Messages received per day.">
