      Maintenence is time-consuming! At some point I have to decide to stop looking after older projects because otherwise that's all I would be doing with my time. Many of my older projects are in states I consider unfinished. Many were intended to get occasional updates and while I did do this in the past, I've made firmer decisions now to stop that. This should not be interpreted as a bad thing. Instead, consider the time now free to make better projects... new ones!

      There has been a shift in my more recent projects (as of 2023) to be shared as full releases only. I do not want to release unfinished projects so I can fix them later. So unless otherwise specified, the projects you see are pretty much final. This also goes along with my sharing of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30427311/">"abandoned projects" on my test account</a>. They're unfinished so I won't share them on my main account, but have content that is still worth something.

      The removal of many cloud variables have also occurred because they are <a href="cloud-vars">high-maintenence</a>.

      The exceptions for project changes I now make are for issues that affect the users negatively that are also reasonably fixable, basically bugs and unintended behaviour that do not require changing significant amounts of the project.

      One example is Truck Driving Challenge. To enable touchscreen mode, you are supposed to press a button in the menu. Too many users complained that there was no touchscreen mode (probably not seeing the button or reading the instuctions). I couldn't change the way the inputs were handled due to how integral they are to the driving code. Instead, there was an easy alternative - detect if the user tries to drive using touchscreen and enable it automatically.
