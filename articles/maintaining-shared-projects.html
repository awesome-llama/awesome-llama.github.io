    <h1>Maintaining Shared Projects</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Maintenence is time-consuming! 
    At some point I have to decide to stop looking after older projects because otherwise that's all I would be doing with my time.
    Many of my older projects are in states I consider unfinished. 
    Many were intended to get occasional updates and while I did do this in the past, I've made firmer decisions now to stop completely.
    This should not be interpreted as a bad thing. Instead, consider the time now free to make better projects... new ones!
    <br><br>
    It's probably a bit subtle but there has been a shift in my more recent projects (as of 2023) to be shared as full releases only. 
    I do not want to release unfinished projects so I can fix them later. 
    So unless otherwise specified, the projects you see are pretty much final.
    This also goes along with my sharing of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30427311/">"abandoned projects" on my test account</a>. They're unfinished so I won't share them on my main account. Nevertheless, I think they have content some might find interesting, so to the test account they go.
    <br><br>
    The only exceptions I now make are for issues that affect the users negatively that are also reasonably fixable, 
    basically bugs and unintended behaviour that do not require changing significant amounts of the project. 
    <br>One example is Truck Driving Challenge. To enable touchscreen mode, you are supposed to press a button in the menu. 
    Too many users complained that there was no touchscreen mode (probably not seeing the button or reading the instuctions). I couldn't change the way the inputs were handled, this is too significant.
    Instead, there was an easy alternative - enable it automatically if the user tries to drive using touchscreen.
    <br>As for Flight Simulator 737, let me address something: No I will not fix altitude hold, add approach mode, or add autopilot. 
    They are complicated things and require too much time. Plus, the core simulation has flaws I realise now that make this a bit more difficult. Again, I'd rather create a new project rather than fix an old one.
