    <h1>Replying to Necroposted Topics</h1>

      "You necroposted, please look at the date of the topic before posting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe I did look at the date, but it probably wasn't me who bumped it to the top with an unnecessary reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      My opinion is that making another reply is fine if it was recently bumped and I have something to add. The "damage" of bumping (displacing recent topics) has already been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider, for a topic to get bumped it needs to be first found. Often it is through Google searches returning many old topics, even those that are closed. It is therefore beneficial to have the topic contain substantial, up-to-date (if applicable) information. This is what I like to address in the case of topics asking for help. I want to help people coming to the topic in the future. The answers provided to the original poster (OP) often are not the full picture, it may be the minimum amount for the OP to find a solution or the OP may abandon their quest entirely. When making my reply, I try to answer the question the OP asked with additional information that they and anyone else searching the question may find useful.
