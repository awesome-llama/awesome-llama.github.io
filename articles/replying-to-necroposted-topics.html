      "You necroposted, please look at the date of the topic before posting."
    </p>
    <p>I probably did look at the date, but it probably wasn't me who bumped it to the top (which is the main issue with necroposting, alongside not adding anything to the discussion). My policy is that making another reply is fine if it was already bumped and I have something to add. Consider, how did this topic get bumped in the first place? Obviously it had to be found in some way, often it is through Google searches which returns many old forum topics. I've seen topics gather many necroposts over the years. Even if the topic gets closed, the topic may remain being returned by searches. It is therefore beneficial to have the topic contain substantial information that is (if applicable) up-to-date. This is what I'm addressing. I want to help people coming to the topic in the future. The answers provided to the original poster (OP) often are not be the full picture, it may be the minimum amount for the OP to find a solution or the OP may abandon their quest entirely. When making my reply, I try to answer the question the OP asked with additional information that they and anyone else searching the question may find useful.</p>
