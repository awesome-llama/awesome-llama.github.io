  <h3>Moving sprites off screen</h3>
  <p class="code">
  No sprite is allowed to move off screen far enough that it cannot be seen. The edge of its costume will always be seen if you were to attempt it. The limit therefore depends on the visual size of the sprite. That includes the size set with the size blocks and the size of the costume. A large costume means that the sprite can more further, however like I just said before, you cannot move it completely off screen, so the edge of that large costume will still be visible. 
  <br>
  If you want to move a sprite completely off screen, a different method is required. First, set the sprite to be visually large, either with a really large costume or the set size blocks. Now, move the sprite to the desired off screen position, and switch the costume back to the one you actually want to see. Now, as the sprite is a smaller costume, it cannot be seen. Note that you have to do this any time you want to move the sprite because if it is off the screen completely and you move it, the sprite will teleport closer so it can be seen.
  <br>
    The code to move a sprite might look like:
  <br>
  [scratchblocks]
  switch costume to [tiny 1x1 costume v]
  set size to (10000) %
  switch costume to [huge 480x360 costume v]
  go to x: (2000) y: (0) // the sprite is visually large so it can move this far
  set size to (100) % // go back to the size you want to display
  switch costume to [desired display costume v] // the costume you want to display
  [/scratchblocks]

  <h3>Rotate towards direction / Signed direction difference</h3>
  <p class="code">
    You can find the signed difference between 2 directions with this:
    difference = (((target direction - current direction) + 180) % 360) - 180
    <br><br>
    in scratchblocks...
    <br>
    [scratchblocks]
    (((((target direction) - (current direction)) + (180)) mod (360)) - (180))
    [/scratchblocks]
    <br><br>
    Then, you can rotate left or right depending on whether the difference is positive or negative.
    I use mod 360 and it does work in this case because of the adding and subtracting of 180 which shifts where the mod wraps the numbers.
    <br><br>
    You can see an interactive example of the above here:

  <h3>Point towards x, y</h3>
  <p class="code">
  The Scratch Wiki Page ( https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/List_of_Block_Workarounds ) has it included near the bottom.
  <br><br>
  [scratchblocks]
  point in direction (([atan v] of (((X) - (x position)) / ((Y) - (y position)))) + (<(y position) > (Y)> * (180)))
  [/scratchblocks]

  <h3>Clones are triggering / Clones using broadcasts / Multiple clones being created</h3>
  <p class="code">
  When a broadcast message is sent, anything can receive it, including clones. The clones are able to react to the spawn broadcast and they will clone themselves too. If you have multiple clones already spawned, then a single broadcast may get you multiple clones spawned at once. 
  </br>The best way to prevent this is to just make sure the broadcast receive hat also checks if it is a clone or not. Two common ways involve costume detection and local variables.
  </br>You could store whether it is a clone or not in a local variable (the ones that are unique to each clone, don't be confused by the default global variable). The original sprite may be set to 0, the clones when created are set to 1. Check if it is 0 and if so, the sprite is original and it can clone itself.
  </br>The costume way involves a costume that the original sprite will always be set to and a costume that the clones will always use. When a clone is created, set to the clone costume. When a broadcast is received, check which costume the sprite/clone is. If it is set to the original costume, it is the original sprite and it will clone itself.

  <h3>Project/stage/screen resolution</h3>
  <p class="code">
  The resolution actually has two answers. If going by the pixels that the blocks use, then the project is 480 pixels across by 360 pixels high. This is an aspect ratio of 4:3.
  </br>However, images can be higher resolution. Projects can actually handle resolutions twice the dimensions, at 960*720. This is the highest resolution supported. If you upload an image at 960*720, that is what you will get, without loss in quality. The image will be shrunken down to fit the screen, where the width of two pixels of that image is equivalent to the width of one pixel of what Scratch reports. This is where the idea of a “half pixel” comes from, if you have heard of it around Scratch. The “half pixel” being the smaller pixel used for images of 960*720.

  <h3>Embedding projects on other external websites</h3>
  <p class="code">
  To add a project in to a website, you can embed it. There is a blue button called "copy link" below the project's notes and credits. Click it and you can take the iframe embed code and paste it into the code of your website. 
  <br>
  [img]https://u.cubeupload.com/unyxium/embed2.png[/img]
  <br>
  Here is an example code from one of my projects: 
  [code=html]&lt;iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/443522259/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;[/code]

  <h3>Saving / save codes in projects</h3>
  <p class="code">
  There are 2 main ways of saving:
  <br>
  1. Save codes -<br>
  When the user wants to save, all the variables and data are combined into a single string via the join block. This code can be copied by the user and saved onto their computer in a text document, or commented under the project. When they want to load the game, they paste the string into an input, and the program pulls the string apart and sets the variables.
  <br>
  2. Cloud lists -<br>
  This is a more complicated, and an extension to 1. Instead of the user saving their code to the computer, your project saves all the data and username to a cloud list and saved into a cloud variable. When the user comes back, their username is the key, which finds the correct data to load.
  <br><br>
  Another way exists, but I only recommend it if you are managing huge amounts of list data, or you can compile everything into lists, and you don't mind having users have to click see inside for the project to be able to access this function. It is also not compatible with cloud data projects as the moment a user sees the inside, they are now unable to edit cloud data and would have to refresh the page to fix.
  <br>
  3. Importing/exporting list data -<br>
  Right-clicking a list in the editor allows you to import and export the data in the list into a file, that can be stored on your computer. You can store all the data including variables in the list when ready for saving. The user can be instructed to export it and download, or to import it when they want to load the data again.

  <h3>Limited sprite size</h3>
  <p class="code">
  Sprite size is limited by the size of the currently-set costume. A sprite can not be too small as to be almost invisible and it also can't be made so big that it will fill the screen many times over. Your costume is probably already small which means your sprite can't be sized any smaller.
  <br>It can by bypassed though. You can switch to a different costume, set the size, and then switch to the costume you want. There's no limitation to switching costumes and the size does not get changed without the use of the size-setting blocks.
  <br>In a script, it would be basically this:
  <br>[scratchblocks]
  <br>switch costume to [big costume v]
  <br>set size to (20) %
  <br>switch costume to [desired costume v]
  <br>[/scratchblocks]

  <h3>Delta time / 60 FPS support</h3>
  <p class="code">
    To account for different frame rates, you can measure the time each frame takes. This change in time is often referred to as [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_timing]"delta time"[/url].

    <br><br>For scratch, the in-built timer appears to be the easy, intuitive method although it is limited by the fact it's not that accurate. Instead I recommend days since 2000 which is more accurate and just as precise.

    <br><br>To find how long the frame took, you can do something like this:

    <br><br>[scratchblocks]
    <br>forever
    <br>set [delta time v] to ((86400) * ((days since 2000) - (last time))) // 86400 makes it measured in seconds and not days
    <br>set [last time v] to (days since 2000)
    <br>end
    <br>[/scratchblocks]

    <br><br>By the way, FPS is just the inverse of delta time (I'll abbreviate it to dt for now on).
    <br>FPS = 1/dt

    <br><br>Finally, to account for different frame rates, you can include the measured delta time in many of your calculations.
    <br>If you wanted a sprite to move at 10px/sec regardless of frame rate, you would simply do this:

    <br><br>[scratchblocks]
    <br>forever
    <br>change x by ((dt) * (10))
    <br>end
    <br>[/scratchblocks]

    <br><br>There's a lot more information that exists about this subject. I'm just giving something for you to start from first, if you want to learn more I can elaborate. Many of my projects make use of these techniques so I am very familar with the subject.

  <h3>Featuring projects/studios</h3>
  <p class="code">
    [b]For featured projects:[/b]
    <br>There is a [url=https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/28715018/]studio[/url] where people can suggest projects. You can't suggest your own and there's no guarantee that suggested projects end up being featured. 
    <br>All you can do is create projects that suit what the ST are looking for, which are listed as:
    <br>[quote]These are the kind of things we're looking for:
    <br>- simple projects
    <br>- complex projects
    <br>- projects that show an innovative use of Scratch
    <br>- projects that promote collaboration and remixing
    <br>- projects by people who haven't been on the front page a lot already
    <br>- projects that show the diversity in our community (gender, age, culture, country, interests, language, etc)
    <br>- projects that different kinds of people would find enjoyable
    <br>- projects that inspire[/quote]
    <br>... and then just wait for someone to suggest it for you. Writing somewhere in the project or its notes and credits asking for someone to suggest it is ok too.

    <br><br>[b]For featured studios:[/b]
    <br>You can suggest it here: https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/516237/
    <br>Unlike projects, you can suggest your own studio. Have a read of the requirements in that topic to understand what the ST are looking for.
