  <h3>Using days since 2000 to calculate the date</h3>
  <p>
  It's a lot more complicated than just taking the time from the other blocks, but still doable.
  <br>
  Firstly, this is days since 2000, so the value given is just that, however fractions are included. 
  <br>
  I have never done this before, so I am trying to solve it in a way that makes sense to me. I think that one way is to find important dates, so knowing how many days between 2000 and 2020 means you can subtract it from the entire amount and know the days since the start of the year (1st Jan 2020). With that, you can work to find the current month based on the lengths of the months before. It is currently the 1st of December, but for an example, assume it is the 12th. You can find the days between the start of the year and start of the month and also subtract it away to reach the current day of the month. 
  <br>
  The complexity comes in how not all years and months are the same lengths. Every 4 years is a leap year, where Feburary gets a 29th day. You have to account for this. The leap years currently include 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. That's 6 extra days.
  <br>
  Knowing exactly how many days since the start of the month now makes it really easy to get the time, as it is much more predictable. Take the decimal part of it as that is the fraction of the current day (e.g. the 0.04338 part of 12.04338). Then, you can get the time through some multiplication. Multiply the fraction by 24 and you get how many hours. Take the fracton part of that again, and multiply by 60 to get minutes, and do it again to get seconds.

  <h3>Moving sprites far off screen</h3>
  <p>
  No sprite is allowed to move off screen far enough that it cannot be seen. The edge of its costume will always be seen if you were to attempt it. The limit therefore depends on the visual size of the sprite. That includes the size set with the size blocks and the size of the costume. A large costume means that the sprite can more further, however like I just said before, you cannot move it completely off screen, so the edge of that large costume will still be visible. 
  <br>
  If you want to move a sprite completely off screen, a different method is required. First, set the sprite to be visually large, either with a really large costume or the set size blocks. Now, move the sprite to the desired off screen position, and switch the costume back to the one you actually want to see. Now, as the sprite is a smaller costume, it cannot be seen. Note that you have to do this any time you want to move the sprite because if it is off the screen completely and you move it, the sprite will teleport closer so it can be seen.
  <br>
    The code to move a sprite might look like:
  <br>
  [scratchblocks]
  switch costume to [tiny 1x1 costume v]
  set size to (10000) %
  switch costume to [huge 480x360 costume v]
  go to x: (2000) y: (0) // the sprite is visually large so it can move this far
  set size to (100) % // go back to the size you want to display
  switch costume to [desired display costume v] // the costume you want to display
  [/scratchblocks]
    
    </p>

  <h3>Point towards x, y</h3>
  <p>
  The Scratch Wiki Page ( https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/List_of_Block_Workarounds ) has it included down near the bottom.
  <br>
  Use this:
  <br>
  [scratchblocks]
  point in direction (([atan v] of (((X) - (x position)) / ((Y) - (y position)))) + (<(y position) > (Y)> * (180)))
  [/scratchblocks]

  <h3>Clones are triggering / Clones using broadcasts / Multiple clones being created</h3>
  <p>
  When a broadcast is sent, it can be received by anything, including clones. The clones are able to react to the spawn broadcast and they will clone themselves too. If you have multiple clones already spawned, then a single broadcast may get you multiple clones spawned at once. 
  </br>
  The best way to prevent this is to just make sure the broadcast receive hat also checks if it is a clone or not. Two common ways involve costume detection and local variables.
  </br>
  You could store whether it is a clone or not in a local variable (the ones that are unique to each clone, don't be confused by the default global variable). The original sprite may be set to 0, the clones when created are set to 1. Check if it is 0 and if so, the sprite is original and it can clone itself.
  </br>
  The costume way involves a costume that the original sprite will always be set to and a costume that the clones will always use. When a clone is created, set to the clone costume. When a broadcast is received, check which costume the sprite/clone is. If it is set to the original costume, it is the original sprite and it will clone itself.

  <h3>Project/stage/screen resolution</h3>
  <p>
  The resolution actually has two answers. If going by the pixels that the blocks use, then the project is 480 pixels across by 360 pixels high. This is an aspect ratio of 4:3.
  </br>
  However, images can be higher resolution. Projects can actually handle resolutions twice the dimensions, at 960*720. This is the highest resolution supported. If you upload an image at 960*720, that is what you will get, without loss in quality. The image will be shrunken down to fit the screen, where the width of two pixels of that image is equivalent to the width of one pixel of what Scratch reports. This is where the idea of a “half pixel” comes from, if you have heard of it around Scratch. The “half pixel” being the smaller pixel used for images of 960*720.

  <h3>Embedding projects on other external websites</h3>
  <p>
  To add a project in to a website, you can embed it. There is a blue button called "copy link" below the project's notes and credits. Click it and you can take the iframe embed code and paste it into the code of your website. 
  <br>
  [img]https://u.cubeupload.com/unyxium/embed2.png[/img]
  <br>
  Here is an example code from one of my projects: 
  [code=html]&lt;iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/443522259/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;[/code]

  <h3>Saving / save codes in projects</h3>
  <p>
  There are 2 main ways of saving:
  <br>
  1. Save codes -<br>
  When the user wants to save, all the variables and data are combined into a single string via the join block. This code can be copied by the user and saved onto their computer in a text document, or commented under the project. When they want to load the game, they paste the string into an input, and the program pulls the string apart and sets the variables.
  <br>
  2. Cloud lists -<br>
  This is a more complicated, and an extension to 1. Instead of the user saving their code to the computer, your project saves all the data and username to a cloud list and saved into a cloud variable. When the user comes back, their username is the key, which finds the correct data to load.
  <br><br>
  Another way exists, but I only recommend it if you are managing huge amounts of list data, or you can compile everything into lists, and you don't mind having users have to click see inside for the project to be able to access this function. It is also not compatible with cloud data projects as the moment a user sees the inside, they are now unable to edit cloud data and would have to refresh the page to fix.
  <br>
  3. Importing/exporting list data -<br>
  Right-clicking a list in the editor allows you to import and export the data in the list into a file, that can be stored on your computer. You can store all the data including variables in the list when ready for saving. The user can be instructed to export it and download, or to import it when they want to load the data again.

  <h3>Limited sprite size</h3>
  <p>
  Sprite size is limited by the size of the currently-set costume. A sprite can not be too small as to be almost invisible and it also can't be made so big that it will fill the screen many times over. Your costume is probably already small which means your sprite can't be sized any smaller.
  <br>
  It can by bypassed though. You can switch to a different costume, set the size, and then switch to the costume you want. There's no limitation to switching costumes and the size does not get changed without the use of the size-setting blocks.
  <br>
  In a script, it would be basically this:
  <br>
  [scratchblocks]
  <br>
  switch costume to [big costume v]
  <br>
  set size to (20) %
  <br>
  switch costume to [desired costume v]
  <br>
  [/scratchblocks]
